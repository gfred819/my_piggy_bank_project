- GIT
Git is a functionality that enables programmers to be able to:
- Create versions of their code so that they can roll back to a previous version in case if any thing goes wrong
- Helps multiple programmers to be able to collaborate on the same project, thus each person can create a copy of the main project,
add their own code and push back to the main project so that it is merged together.

One platform that helps us to push codes is GITHUB.

GITHUB
- Github is a centralized platform where multiple developers all over the world can store and share their codes  with other developers around the world.
- It can also serve as your portfolio.
- To get started, you will need to create an account on github.com


Steps in using GIT
- Initializet the folder or project as a git repository. This will enable git to start tracking all the files in that folder.

-  Add the latest file changes through staging. This enables git to track the latest files
- Commit the staged changes with a message.
- Push the commited changes to Github
